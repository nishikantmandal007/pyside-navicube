# NavCube

NavCube is a 3D orientation cube widget for PySide6. Drop it into any 3D viewport — OCC, VTK, custom OpenGL, whatever you're using — and it just works. No renderer dependency, no shared OpenGL context, no lifecycle headaches.

## Why NavCube exists

NavCube grew out of real pain in [Osdag](https://osdag.fossee.in), an open-source structural steel design tool built on PythonOCC. Osdag lets users open multiple design tabs, each with its own 3D renderer. We wanted a navigation cube on every tab — and that's where things got ugly.

OCC's built-in ViewCube lives inside the OpenGL context, sharing its lifecycle with the renderer. The moment you start creating and destroying tabs, you're fighting crashes: OCC objects outliving their context, double-free errors on tab close, the cube randomly rendering into the wrong viewport. The root cause is that the cube and the renderer are too tightly coupled — they live and die together.

The fix was to pull the cube out of OCC entirely. NavCube is a plain PySide6 `QWidget` that draws itself with `QPainter`. No OpenGL, no OCC handles, no shared context. When a tab closes, the widget goes away like any other Qt widget. The crashes disappeared.

The bonus: since the widget doesn't care about your renderer, it works with VTK, custom OpenGL, or anything else. So it became its own library.

## How it works

NavCube talks to your renderer through exactly two hooks:

- **You push** the camera state in: `cube.push_camera(dx, dy, dz, ux, uy, uz)`
- **It emits** orientation changes out: `cube.viewOrientationRequested`

That's the entire integration surface. The widget has no idea what's rendering behind it — and it doesn't need to.

## Features

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Renderer-agnostic** | The core widget only needs PySide6 + NumPy. No OCC, no VTK, no OpenGL required. |
| **Ready-made connectors** | `OCCNavCubeSync` and `VTKNavCubeSync` handle camera polling and signal wiring so you don't have to. |
| **Full style control** | 60+ fields in `NavCubeStyle` covering colors, fonts, labels, animation speed, and opacity. You can change everything at runtime. |
| **Smooth animations** | Quaternion SLERP with antipodal handling. No gimbal lock, no NaN crashes on 180° flips. |
| **Z-up and Y-up** | Z-up out of the box (OCC, FreeCAD, Blender). One-line subclass to switch to Y-up (Unity, Three.js). |
| **DPI-aware** | Scales correctly from 96 DPI all the way to 4K Retina. Recalculates automatically when you move between monitors. |

## Install

```bash
pip install navcube            # core only
pip install navcube[occ]       # + OCC connector
pip install navcube[vtk]       # + VTK connector
```

---

## Quick start

```python
from navcube import NavCubeOverlay

cube = NavCubeOverlay(parent=your_3d_widget)
cube.show()

cube.viewOrientationRequested.connect(your_camera_update)
cube.push_camera(dx, dy, dz, ux, uy, uz)
```

## Sign convention quick reference

| | |
|:--|:--|
| `push_camera` dx/dy/dz | **Inward** (eye → scene) — same as OCC `cam.Direction()` |
| `viewOrientationRequested` px/py/pz | **Outward** (scene → eye) — ready for OCC `SetProj()` |
