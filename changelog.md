## v1.0.0

**Initial release.**

This is the first public version of NavCube — extracted from Osdag and polished into a standalone library.

### What's included

**NavCubeOverlay** — a pure PySide6 widget that draws a FreeCAD-style NaviCube with `QPainter`:
- 6 main faces, 12 edge faces, 8 corner faces with FreeCAD-style chamfered geometry
- Orbit buttons (North/South/East/West), roll arrows (Left/Right), home button, and backside dot
- Smooth quaternion SLERP animations with antipodal handling — no NaN crashes on 180° flips
- Quintic ease-in-out animation curve for natural-feeling motion
- Per-face Lambertian shading with configurable light direction
- Back-face culling with a configurable visibility threshold
- DPI-aware rendering that recalculates automatically when moved between monitors
- Overlay mode (transparent floating window) and inline mode (standard QWidget)
- Light and dark theme support with automatic detection from `QPalette`

**NavCubeStyle** — full visual control through a Python dataclass:
- 60+ configurable fields covering geometry, animation, colors, fonts, labels, borders, and shadows
- Runtime style swapping via `set_style()` with a full rebuild and repaint
- Separate light-theme and dark-theme color palettes
- Customizable face labels — any language, any script
- Configurable font family, weight, and size constraints
- Optional XYZ axis gizmo with configurable colors

**Coordinate system support:**
- Z-up by default (OCC, FreeCAD, Blender)
- Y-up via `_WORLD_ROT` class attribute override (Three.js, Unity, Unreal)
- Clear sign convention: `push_camera()` takes the inward direction, `viewOrientationRequested` emits the outward direction

**OCCNavCubeSync** — OCC V3d_View connector:
- Adaptive poll rate: every tick during interaction, every 4 ticks at idle
- Atomic camera updates via `Camera.SetEye()` + `Camera.SetUp()` to eliminate animation flicker
- Fallback to `SetProj`/`SetUp` for older pythonocc builds
- Clean teardown with no dangling references

**VTKNavCubeSync** — VTK renderer connector:
- Same architecture and API as the OCC connector

**SLERP smoothing during live camera interaction:**
- Quaternion-based smoothing (alpha 0.65) absorbs momentary renderer instabilities
- ~8 ms effective visual lag — imperceptible in use
- Automatically turns off when interaction ends

### Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
